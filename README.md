# LangChain-as-AnyAI
Under Construction, nothing implemented yet. Or maybe I can say "Coming soon..."?


Deploy any str to str LangChain (at least 0.1.0) Runnable as Any popular AI API protocol Server locally, including being OpenAI API Server, Google Gemini Server, and more. After that, your downstream applications that are previously solely based on ChatGPT can seamlessly switch to be based on any LangChain Runnable, by which you can leverage LLM besides ChatGPT, integrate Retrieval Augmented Generation with langchain, and more exciting functions supported by LangChain. All you need after running `LangChain-as-AnyAI` is to change your `OPENAI_BASE_URL` to the locally deployed `LangChain-as-AnyAI` Server, acting as an OpenAI Protocol compatible Server.
